What I have learned from this course. So far in this course, I have learned how to use Git and GitHub to manage and collaborate on coding projects. I now understand how version control works, including creating repositories, committing changes, and pushing updates to GitHub. I’ve also learned how to use Visual Studio Code effectively by integrating it with GitHub, which helps me track my progress and work more efficiently. These skills have improved my confidence in handling software projects and collaborating with others in a professional workflow.
